## Installation
Works on Windows XP and later OS.

CLCL will be installed when you launch the downloaded file.

Please uninstall from the Control Panel after closing CLCL.

Data will be saved in the following folder (for Windows 10):

    C:\Users\\\{username\}\AppData\Local\CLCL

To save data in the same location as CLCL.exe, set clcl_app.ini as follows and then start CLCL.

    [GENERAL]
    portable=1

## Startup
When you start CLCL, a clip icon will be displayed in the task tray (the area with the clock in the corner of the taskbar).
Clicking on this task tray icon will display a menu.
By default, the menu displays the history in ascending order.
The menu can be customized in the settings.

Right-clicking on the task tray icon will display the viewer.
The left side of the viewer is a tree that displays the history and template items.
The right side of the viewer displays and edits the contents of the history and template items. The edited contents will be reflected in the item when you move the focus. Some formats cannot be edited. The contents of the current clipboard cannot be edited.

The "Clipboard" at the top of the tree is the current clipboard contents.
The "History" in the tree is a list of the history.
"Templates" in the tree is a list of template items (such as standard phrases).

## Clipboard
### What is the clipboard?
The clipboard is an area for exchanging information between different applications.
For example, you can paste text copied in Notepad into Word, and this is because the clipboard is used.

### Clipboard format
The clipboard can hold multiple formats at once.
For example, if you copy text in Notepad, the following four formats will be stored in the clipboard (Windows 10):

	・UNICODE TEXT
	・LOCALE
	・TEXT
	・OEM TEXT
If you copy in Excel or Access, even more formats will be sent to the clipboard.

CLCL's default settings are:

	・UNICODE TEXT - Text
	・BITMAP - Bitmap
	・DROP FILE LIST - File
These formats will be saved in the history.
You can also save other formats in the history by using the optional "Filter".

## History
This is the history of data copied to the clipboard.
Newly copied data is added to the top of the history.

A single history item contains multiple clipboard formats. The clipboard formats with the highest priority are displayed in the menu and viewer, which are registered in the optional "Format".

The number of history items remains as set in the optional "History".
Only clipboard formats set to add in the optional "Filter" are added to the history.

## Templates
Templates can be used to register commonly used data such as standard phrases.
You can add folders to organize them into hierarchical structures and give names to items.

To add a template item, open the viewer, select the history item, and select "Add to Templates" from the menu.
Select the folder you want to add in the tree, and select "Create New" from the menu to create an item by loading the contents of an empty item or file.

To add a folder, open the viewer, right-click on the location in the templates where you want to add it, and select "Create Folder."

To rename a folder or item, open the viewer, select the item you want to rename, right-click on it, and select "Rename."
"Initialize Name" erases the name you set and displays the item's contents as the name.
If you name an item "-", it will be displayed as a separator in the menu. The format and data in the item will be ignored.
If you add & to the name, the character following it will be used as the shortcut key in the menu. If you want to display & itself in the menu, use &&.

Right-click on a template item to display the menu and select "Hotkey Settings" to assign a hotkey to the template item. Pressing that key will send the template item directly to the clipboard without displaying the menu, and will paste it directly if "Paste" is enabled.
You can check the registered hotkeys in the list display area of the viewer. If you select other template items, they will be displayed in the status bar.

There is no limit to the number of template items or the clipboard format.

## Send to Clipboard
There are several ways to send history or template items to the clipboard.

-  Click the task tray to bring up a menu.
If you select a history or template item from the menu, the data will be sent to the clipboard and automatically pasted into the active window.

- Press the hotkey (default is Alt + C) to bring up a menu.
If you select a history or template item from the menu, the data will be sent to the clipboard and automatically pasted into the active window.

- Select an item in the viewer and bring up a right-click menu.
If you select "Send to Clipboard", the selected item will be sent to the clipboard.

## Menu
The menu items displayed in the task tray or hotkey are set in the "Action" option.
You can customize the menu behavior and display in the "Menu" option.

If you move the mouse over a history or template item in the menu, a tooltip with detailed information will be displayed at the mouse position. If you select an item with the keyboard, a tooltip will be displayed under the menu item.

Right-clicking on a history or template item will display the registered tools in a menu, and the selected tool will be executed and sent to the clipboard.

To display the tool menu with the keyboard, press Ctrl and Enter to select an item.

History and template items display menu items according to the "Menu text display format" option. The displayed numbers start from 0, but if you want to change the starting value, set the starting number between the % and the character.

Examples:

	%0d -> 0,1,2,3...
	%8x -> 8,9,a,b...
	%1n -> 1,2,3...8,9,0,1,2...
	%10B -> K,L,M,N...

## Action
The action when the hotkey is pressed or the task tray icon is clicked can be set in the "Action" option.

When you specify "Menu" as the action in Edit Action, you can set the menu items to display in the menu settings at the bottom of the screen.

Invoking method sets the method for invoking the specified action.

When you specify "Hotkey", set the key to invoke.
"Ctrl + Ctrl", "Shift + Shift", and "Alt + Alt" invoke the specified action when you press the key twice.

If you specify Menu as the action, you can set "Paste".
When you select an item in the menu, the paste action is automatically sent to the application you are working in.
If you hold down Shift when selecting a menu item, it will not be pasted but will only be sent to the clipboard.

If you specify Menu as the action and Hotkey, Ctrl + Ctrl, Shift + Shift, or Alt + Alt as the invoking method, you can set "Show at caret position".
"Show at caret position" displays the menu at the caret position of the editor.
If you do not set it, the menu will be displayed at the mouse position.

If you specify Menu as the action and select History as the item, you can set the display range. The display range is specified from 1 to the number of items to be left in the history. Specifying 0 as the start number is the same as specifying 1, and specifying 0 as the end number is the same as specifying the number of items to be left in the history.

If the end number is smaller than the start number, nothing will be displayed. If the end number is larger than the number of items to be left in the history, only the number of items to be left in the history will be displayed.

## Clipboard format
CLCL can process all clipboard formats, but clipboard formats that are not registered will be displayed as binary dumps in the viewer.

Clipboard formats are registered in the options "Format". The registered format at the top takes priority, and the clipboard format with the highest priority among the items is displayed in the menu and viewer.

To register, set the format name, the DLL to be processed, and the function header. If you omit the DLL and press the function header selection button, a list of built-in function headers will be displayed.
For example, if you want to process the CSV clipboard format as text when copying in Excel, set it as follows:
	Format name: CSV
	DLL:
	Function header: text_
The menu and viewer will process it as text.

### Filter
To select the clipboard format, set it in the "Filter" option.

If you select "Add all formats to history", all clipboard formats except those set to be excluded will be added to the history.

If you select "Exclude all formats from history", only clipboard formats set to be added will be added to the history.

For clipboard formats set to be added in the filter, you can further set the size limit when adding to the history. Data exceeding the limit size will not be added to the history.

If you set the clipboard format set to be added in the filter to "Do not save", it will not be saved to a file when CLCL is closed.
For example, you can set it to add text and bitmaps to the history and save only the text.

## Window settings
If you want to change the behavior of CLCL depending on the application you use, set the window and behavior in the "Window" option.

Specify the window title and class name, and use "*" as any character.
For example, for Notepad, set it as follows:

	Title: * - Notepad
	Class name: Notepad

The behavior of CLCL will change when Notepad is active.
Either the title or the class name needs to be entered, and if it is not entered, it is the same as specifying only "*".

- Don't add to history:
    Copying in the set window will not be added to the history.
    If you specify this option for an application that causes problems when added to the history, copying from that application will be ignored.

- Don't set focus: 
	Focus will not be set after activating the set window.
	If the focus goes somewhere when pasting the selected menu item and the pasting is not performed correctly, specifying this option may make it work correctly.

- Paste even if the tool is canceled: 
	When canceling a cancelable tool, the subsequent pasting is usually not performed, but if this option is specified, the pasting will be performed even if it is canceled.
	If you set the copy key as the cut key in the key settings for each window, specifying this option will prevent the characters from disappearing even if you cancel the tool.

## Key settings for each window
Select the history or template item from the hotkey, and the paste action will automatically send the paste key to the window.
By default, Ctrl + V is sent to all windows, but depending on the window, the paste key may be a different key.

When the tool is called with a hotkey, the copy key (Ctrl + C) is sent to the window to perform the Copy -> Tool Processing -> Paste action.

The copy and paste keys for each window are set in the "Key" option.
Set the title and class name of the window to be set and set the copy and paste keys.

If the copy and paste keys are not set, the default key settings will be used.

Multiple keys can be set for one window. If multiple keys are set, the keys will be sent in order from the top.

## Tools (plug-ins)
To process history or template item data or expand the functions of CLCL, set it in the "Tool" option.

When you select the DLL and function name, the tool name and execution timing will be automatically set.
The "Action Menu" execution timing allows you to execute from the menu set in the action option.
The "Viewer" execution timing allows you to execute from the viewer's tool menu.

The "Send copy and paste" execution timing sends a copy to the active window, executes a tool on the copied data, and pastes the execution results into the active window.
If this option is not checked, the tool is executed on the most recent history item and sent to the clipboard. In the tool menu that appears when you right-click an item in the action menu, the tool is executed on the selected item and sent to the clipboard.
If "Paste" is not enabled in the action settings, pasting will not be performed after copying and executing the tool.

Drag and drop a DLL into the tool list window to display a list of tools that can be registered, and you can select multiple tools to register them all at once.

## Command Line
When starting CLCL, you can specify a command line to specify the operation after startup.
If CLCL is already running, the command will be sent to the already running CLCL.
#### Format:

	CLCL.exe [/vownx]
		/v Display viewer
		/w Monitor clipboard
		/n Cancel monitoring clipboard
		/x Exit
